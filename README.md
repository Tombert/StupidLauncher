# Stupid Launcher

So I bought a Nook Glowlight 4 Plus recently.  Despite it running Android, and despite it being easy to install stuff via ADB, it's actually hard to *use* the stuff sideloaded, like KOReader. Stuff is easy to launch via ADB but I don't want to plug in my computer every time I reboot the Nook. 

My solution? Make a very dumb Android app that starts the launcher thirty seconds after reboot. 

This requires that you have [Simple App Launcher](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.applauncher/) installed.
